## Steps for pond (Needs refinement)
- find place
    - free of trees

    - mark outlines with sand
    - mark different water depths with sand
    - about 10 cm deeper than the form
    - deep parts first
    - shallow parts later on
    - measure often
- fill in 10cm layer of fine sand
- insert
    - fill gaps with sand and water

    - plants into plant bags / cases
    - use only special earth for ponds
    - small stones on top, so the earth stays inside
    - water plants before inserting them
    - put them into shallow water first for a few weeks before putting them into the destination depth
