Pump chosen by Nikita: https://www.obi.de/teichpumpen-filter/filter-und-bachlaufpumpe-pondomax-eco-2500/p/3151321 - Filter is included in the case.
Reason: This water pump has suitable specifications for our pond. it provides just enough water flow to circulate in our 1000L pond and can delivery water up to 1.9m height.

Additional airiating device was pitched: https://www.obi.de/teichbelueftung/heissner-smartline-teichbeluefter-200l-h/p/9065319 - Doesn't seem to be necessary, as no fish are going to live inside the pond and the waterfall should airiate the water enough.
